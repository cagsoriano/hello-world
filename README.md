Nanay trials I

Diaries of a fumbling nanay

Blaring filipino tv show playing
Girls dancing in an energetic foreign song is the usual opening act
My little girl curious, and infected with the same excitement as what she is seeing for the first time;
While I try to brood on what I should write about myself
